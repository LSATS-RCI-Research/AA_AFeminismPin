Original artwork and design by Allana Tran.

Schematic and PCB development by Joe Bauer.


Assembly Directions:

1) Place the two resistors. You'll see rectangles printed on the back side along where it says "M Digital Scholarship" - these represent where the resistors should go. Bend the resistor legs and feed them through those holes and solder them on the front side. Then clip the legs flush on the front side.
2) Place the black battery holder on the back side in the large printed circle. The squared off side of the holder goes to the left and its pin goes through the hole with the square metal surrounding it. Solder these from the front side.
3) Place the two buttons in the rectangle-marked spaces on the front in the bottom-right corner. These are soldered from the back side. 
4) Place the two LEDs from the back side. The short pin goes through the hole with the square metal surrounding it. Bend the LED flat against the back so it touches the non-purple (sort of beige) part. Then, solder them from the front side and clip the legs flush on the front side. 
5) If you want it to be a pin, either superglue the safety pin onto the rectangular metal section on the top of the back side, or carefully solder it on through the two holes. If you solder it, keep in mind that it'll take a longer time to heat up. 
6) Place the battery in the holder on the back side (the + side goes up) and then press the buttons on the front side. You should see the LEDs light up through the front "screen" above the cat. If you hold the buttons they will change color over time. Congratulations!
